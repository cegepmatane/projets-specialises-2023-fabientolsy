Yeah, yeah, it's way too dangerous
Yeah, yeah, there's too much at stake
Mom told me "there are too many envious people"
Yeah, that sounds hollow 'cause they don't believe in them
I'm just a mad scientist, a mad love seeker
I spend hours in my lab
I already told you but it drives me crazy
I see everything blurry when I have tears in my eyes
I think about the future, work to make it happy
Come on come on
Put on your astronaut outfit
You know we're not like the others
Come on let's start the ship, give me the keys
The stars, we will touch them
I have things to settle, people to capture
Yes, up there on the window side in the ship
I hope you're proud when I write these words
Yes, dad, we'll catch it all up there
Stop your dark thoughts, poto
Stress so back to the lab
You go on a quest like Cousteau commando
Head full of ideas but never out of water
Mi coraz√≥n is heavy, what a burden
My bigo rings
I smoke in your ear and it's tempting
Even at 20, I could show love to the grown-ups, but in short
A full black shot, a full white shot and here we go again
We pause, enjoy the moment then start, launch the game
Come on, put on your astronaut outfit
Need oxygen in space to have music in my galaxy
So you stay rooted to the ground to hear my melodies
And even in bed, headphones in my ears to listen to what I'm saying
Mission accomplished, every new line, welcome to paradise
Practice chemistry to achieve alchemy
Look for an alibi that explains your fury
Choose your friends wisely since they calm your cries
When there's heartache, there's an epidemic
Remedies, you know them, we cure the disease
Draw geometry, give meaning to your life
Life has toughened you up, there are no smooth edges
Flies come out in print not for magic
Yeah, yeah, it's way too dangerous
Yeah, yeah, there's too much at stake
Mom told me, there are too many envious people
Yeah it sounds hollow since they don't believe in them
I'm just a mad scientist, a mad love seeker
I spend hours in my lab
I already told you but it drives me crazy
I see everything blurry when I have tears in my eyes
I think about the future, work to make it happy
Come on come on
Put on your astronaut outfit
You know we're not like the others
Come on let's start the ship, give me the keys
The stars, we will touch them
I have things to settle, people to capture
Time passes and you wait for the summer sunset
The sanitized blue sky that comes to soften your ideas
I'm tired of seeing you weaving with the devil you pact
I see your smile twitch and your little eyes squint
Come on, I want us to help each other
Behind my texts, does happiness give way
I engage all the gears
When I rap incessantly, in front of my guys, never any weakness
It's much too dangerous and you know there's too much at stake
She told me "there are too many envious people", yeah
Yeah with them it sounds hollow
I'm just a mad scientist, a mad love seeker
I spend hours in my lab
I already told you but it drives me crazy
I see everything blurry when I have tears in my eyes
I think about the future, work to make it happy
Come on come on
Put on your astronaut outfit
You know we're not like the others
Come on let's start the ship, give me the keys
The stars, we will touch them
I have things to settle, people to capture
Yeah, yeah, it's way too dangerous
Yeah, yeah, there's too much at stake
Mom told me, there are too many envious people
Yeah it sounds hollow since they don't believe in them
Yeah, hey, they don't believe in them
They don't believe in them
They don't believe in them
O.K, wait, I have an idea
Oh, change your guitar, let's try something please
I'm back from star wars
Gravity sets in
Tell me if from up there the earth reveals itself
Dream of visceral happiness
But utopia sometimes hurts
Ouch ouch ouch ouch
I imagine myself old bearded man, damn mad scientist
A great seeker of mad love
And the pressure is building in your spacesuit
I dream that you come back down to see ours again
And we're not like the others
And you already know it, but
You don't understand and
It's not your fault, no
No, I don't blame you, no
Nah I don't want it
I dream of describing, of writing what I never knew how to say
Me, me, I want to feel
I want to feel alive and even know the worst
Aim for the smile in my sights, I have life in my sights
I have life and its few sighs
You need to suffer to know the pleasure
The real, the desire that makes you want to act
Music is the key to my heart and open it
And we take off, I see the light dim
And we take off reality gets damaged
But suddenly I open my eyes
This is the end of the movie
Is it all dust?
Am I in the abyss?
Is it all dust?
Am I in the abyss?
In the end, I take the time to feel
To laugh, since I've known the worst
To write what I never knew how to say
Because, because in a second life
Life can run away
Astronaut
