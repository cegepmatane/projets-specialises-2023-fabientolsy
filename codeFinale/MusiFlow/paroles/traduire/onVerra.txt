We skip class, laziness marks the daily life han, han
Being in a relationship, it only hurts when you stick to it han, han
Even if I have nothing to prove, I feel a bit alone han, han
I still haven't found the missing piece of the puzzle han, han
In possession of drugs, young people are partygoers han, han
What irony to die in a fetal position han, han
I've barely been born, tomorrow I'll be old han, han
But I'm going to do everything to be forever this dreamer han, han
We'll see what the future holds for us.
We'll see, go ahead, come, we don't think about it
We'll see what the future holds for us.
We'll see, we'll see
Tonight, we'll go for a walk to the open grocer downstairs
And we'll talk about love, huddled together on a veranda
Raised by a real ronne-da, I have values that they won't see
Being a man takes time
How to order a canned drink
I get dizzy when I think of the whole road
What I have left to accomplish
I'm ready to bust your balls if you've been drinking
I won't let you drive
Time flies, we are afraid to chain defeats and then miss
His life, no projects apart from watching pirated DVDs
Oh, we'll see
This world drives you crazy, everyone is at war han, han
The more we bail out and the less we see clearly han, han
When you have no money, in this world, you have no rights han, han
There are those who break a head and those who hit three han, han
How many times have I flown out of laziness waiting in line? Han Han
My dad doesn't believe me, my clothes smell like cold tobacco han, han
We get pissed off on the job, we wait for the cances-va han, han
We talk behind a computer but, in real life, when do we see each other? Han Han
We'll see what the future holds for us.
We'll see, go ahead, come, we don't think about it
We'll see what the future holds for us.
We'll see, we'll see
Here, not only does it rap
But when there's a big ceau-mor it comes around
Don't be afraid of the insults we throw at each other
Arabic-sounding
We're all in the same boat
Even the ones we don't really like
Because love, sound and food have become fast consumption
Young people think more of dumb stars than Martin Luther King
Never get up before noon except on the morning of a raid
While his friends were revising, little Ken became a writer
Yes, I only think about having fun but for coke I have Krillin's nose
S-Crew
(Ha, ha) 1.9.9.5
(Han, han) we don't give a fuck about anything
(Han, han) Blackbird
(Han, han) The Entourage
(Han, han) we don't give a fuck about nothing no
Our bodies work backwards, we walk with heads
We feel with a look and we play with the nerves
Me, I speak with my hands, sometimes I think with my
But I touch with my thoughts and I write with my heart
I do not have
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, I really don't
Don't give a fuck about anything, don't give a fuck about anything, we'll see
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, I really don't
Don't give a fuck about anything, don't give a fuck about anything, we'll see
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, I really don't
Don't give a fuck about anything, don't give a fuck about anything, we'll see
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, I really don't
Don't give a fuck about anything, don't give a fuck about anything, we'll see
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, I really don't
Don't give a fuck about anything, don't give a fuck about anything, we'll see
Don't give a fuck, give a fuck
